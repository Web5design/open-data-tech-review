# Open Data Technologies #

There are a range of technologies that address different problems with creating, publishing and using open data. The aim of this project is to pull together information about these technologies, their advantages and disadvantages, to enable those who are performing these tasks to choose an appropriate technology.

We are using the [Wiki](/theodi/open-data-tech-review/wiki/Home) to collaboratively build a set of reviews of the technologies. Please join in!
